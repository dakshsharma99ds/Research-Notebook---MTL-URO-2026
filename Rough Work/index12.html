    <h1>🌍 My Research Journey</h1>

    <div class="story">Hi, I’m <span class="highlight">Saloni Joshi</span>.  
      For me, this is not just an application — it is my <span class="highlight">first real step into research</span>. I believe courage, curiosity, and self-learning are the foundation of discovery.
    </div>

    <div class="story">💡 <strong>My Lab from Scratch</strong>  
      When I first encountered the research of <em>Matter to Life</em>, I didn’t understand a single word. But instead of stepping back, I built my own <span class="highlight">mini-lab — simulations, visualizations, and tools</span> from scratch. These may look simple, but they represent my determination to learn, explore, and create.
    </div>

    <div class="story">⚡ <strong>Smart Work Strategy</strong>  
      I chose to focus on depth over breadth. That’s why I built a clear hero section, a structured About Me, and a research draft with interactive tools. Together, these reflect not only my skills but also <span class="highlight">how I think, how I learn, and how I solve problems</span>.
    </div>

    <div class="story">🚀 <strong>Storyline to Germany</strong>  
      I believe deeply: <em>“I am already on my way to Germany, and God is with me.”</em>  
      This fearless conviction gives me strength. Even if I am not selected today, my journey has already begun — and some of the brightest researchers have already resonated with my curiosity.
    </div>

    <div class="story">💪 <strong>Energy & Resilience</strong>  
      Yes, I am writing this through fever and migraine — but that only makes my commitment stronger. Research is not about being perfect; it is about persistence, balance, and the will to push forward.
    </div>

    <div class="story">✨ <strong>Why This Matters</strong>  
      This project is not just a “submission.”  
      It is the story of how I transformed confusion into creation, and fear into faith.
      <blockquote>
        “When I first saw your work, I didn’t understand a single word.  
        But I decided to build my own mini-lab to learn.  
        This project is the result of my journey to understand and contribute.”
