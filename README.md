# MtL Lab Simulations â€“ Research Notebook

This repository contains my **independent research explorations** inspired by the work of the **Boekhoven, Zwicker, and Sarah Loos Labs**.  
It showcases simulations and observations from self-initiated experiments in reaction networks, reaction-diffusion systems, and active matter dynamics.

## Research Overview

- **Boekhoven Lab:**  
  Simulated a fuel-driven **Aâ†’Bâ†’C reaction network** with 3 adjustable parameters: **fuel concentration**, **rate constants**, and **initial droplet size**. Observed emergent droplet **growth, division, and pattern formation**.

- **Zwicker Lab:**  
  Modeled **reaction-diffusion systems**, showing how small changes in parameters produce drastically different **self-organization outcomes**, consistent with lab hypotheses.

- **Sarah Loos Lab:**  
  Simulated **active matter dynamics** including **clustering, oscillations, and nonequilibrium states**. Documented results in an interactive digital notebook using **Python** and **JavaScript**.

## Tools & Technologies

- **Programming:** Python, JavaScript  
- **Libraries:** NumPy, Matplotlib  
- **Documentation:** Jupyter Notebook, Markdown

## Repository Status

ðŸš§ **Work in progress** â€“ This repository will be updated regularly with **new simulations, observations, and improved visualizations**.
